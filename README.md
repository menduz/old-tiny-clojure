# Tiny Clojure

This is a tiny Clojure interpreter. The motivation behind this project is to have a lightweight subset of clojure to run sandboxed scripts in a web game I'm creating.

It is also a good candidate to solve many scripting-related problems I had in the past.

## Why Cloure?

It is a good LISP that proved itself in many ways.

## Why a lisp?

I recently had that showerthought where you realize that if Star Trek will ever exist, everything in the Star Fleet will have to be somehow a LISP.

# Methodology

I'll try to do as few things as I can in the host language (TypeScript). Trying to implement as much logic as I can in Clojure directly.

In the future I'd like to use this same project to compile Clojure to WebAssembly.
